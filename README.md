# Supergraph for Claude Code

> [Tiếng Việt](./README-VI.md)

**Turn Claude Code from a code generator into an engineering workflow system.**

> SuperGraph doesn't make Claude Code smarter.
> It makes Claude Code behave like a disciplined engineer.

SuperGraph enforces planning, TDD, verification, review, and architecture-aware decision making through mandatory workflows, graph intelligence, and LSP-powered code analysis.

## Why Supergraph

| Without Supergraph | With Supergraph |
|---|---|
| Claude guesses which files are affected | Graph shows exact blast radius before first keystroke |
| TDD is optional | RED test is mandatory — no production code without a failing test |
| "It works on my machine" | 6-phase diagnose loop with deterministic feedback |
| Review is an afterthought | Independent reviewer agent + graph cross-check before every merge |
| Context lost between sessions | Handoff skill compacts full session state in seconds |
| Refactors break hidden callers | Serena LSP finds every reference before rename runs |

---

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI | ✅ Yes | See Claude Code docs |
| Python 3.10+ | ✅ Yes | `brew install python` / `apt install python3` |
| [code-review-graph](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph) | ✅ Yes | `pip install code-review-graph` |
| [Serena MCP](https://github.com/oraios/serena) | Optional | See [Serena Setup](#serena-setup) |
| Git | ✅ Yes | Already installed on most systems |

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — Git Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Add plugin marketplace from Git repo
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/datit309/supergraph.git

# Install the plugin
/plugin install supergraph

# Update later
/plugin marketplace update supergraph
```

### Option 2 — Local Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datit309/supergraph.git

/plugin marketplace add ./supergraph
/plugin install supergraph
```

---

## Graph Setup

The codebase graph must be built once per project. It powers blast radius analysis, hub node detection, and community boundaries.

```bash
# Install the graph tool
pip install code-review-graph

# Register the MCP server in your project
code-review-graph install

# Build the initial graph index
code-review-graph build
```

Verify the graph is healthy:

```bash
code-review-graph status
```

The graph updates automatically after every file write (via `PostToolUse` hook). Rebuild manually after large merges:

```bash
code-review-graph build
```

---

## Serena Setup

Serena adds LSP-level intelligence: find all callers, safe cross-codebase rename, type diagnostics. Optional but recommended for complex refactors.

```bash
# Install Serena MCP server
pip install serena

# Add to your project's .mcp.json
serena install
```

Once installed, all supergraph skills automatically use Serena tools where available (`find_referencing_symbols`, `get_diagnostics_for_file`, `rename_symbol`, etc.).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start a session — always run scan first
/supergraph:scan

# 2. Plan before any non-trivial change
/supergraph:plan

# 3. Implement with TDD
/supergraph:tdd

# 4. Auto-fix after coding
/supergraph:fix

# 5. Verify before claiming done
/supergraph:verify

# 6. Review before merge
/supergraph:review
```

**Small change (1-2 files, <10 lines)?** Skip plan → `/supergraph:tdd` → `/supergraph:fix` → `/supergraph:review`

---

## Workflow

```
SESSION START
  → /supergraph:scan
  → Load graph, detect language, save .supergraph-env
         │
         ▼
PLANNING PHASE
  → /supergraph:analyze   (ambiguous scope, hub/bridge nodes)
  → /supergraph:plan      (blast radius, task breakdown, user approval)
  → Save to docs/supergraph/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
         │
    ┌────┴────────────────────┐
    ▼                         ▼
SMALL CHANGE              LARGE CHANGE

/supergraph:tdd           /supergraph:execute
    │                         │ (parallel tasks)
    └────────┬────────────────┘
             ▼
  Per task: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → commit
             │
             ▼
  /supergraph:fix
  Tests + lint + format + graph (max 3 iterations)
             │
             ▼
  /supergraph:integration   (if e2e configured)
             │
             ▼
  /supergraph:verify        (evidence gate)
             │
             ▼
  /supergraph:review        (graph-aware, independent agent)
  → APPROVED / NEEDS_CHANGES / BLOCKED
```

## Skills

All skills use the `/supergraph:` prefix to avoid conflicts with built-in commands.

### Core Workflow

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/supergraph:scan` | Load graph, detect project language, save env | **First thing every session** |
| `/supergraph:analyze` | Risk analysis + structured grill + approach selection | Ambiguous scope, hub/bridge nodes involved |
| `/supergraph:plan` | Graph scan, blast radius, task breakdown with TDD mapping | Before writing any non-trivial code |
| `/supergraph:execute` | Dispatch saved plan, orchestrate parallel/sequential tasks | Plan is saved and approved |
| `/supergraph:tdd` | RED → GREEN → REFACTOR per task | Implementing any feature or fix |
| `/supergraph:fix` | Auto-fix loop: test + lint + format + graph check | After all coding, before claiming done |
| `/supergraph:integration` | Run integration and e2e tests | After unit tests pass |
| `/supergraph:verify` | Fresh evidence gate — no claims without proof | Before done/ready/commit |
| `/supergraph:review` | Independent code reviewer agent + graph cross-check | Before merge or PR |

### Debugging & Investigation

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/supergraph:diagnose` | 6-phase debug: reproduce → hypothesize → instrument → fix | Bug exists, cause unknown |
| `/supergraph:zoom-out` | One-shot domain-vocabulary module map | Lost in unfamiliar code, need re-orientation |
| `/supergraph:architecture` | HTML + Mermaid architecture review report | Pre-refactor, onboarding, architectural planning |

### Planning & Requirements

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/supergraph:prd` | Convert conversation → structured PRD + GitHub Issue | Requirements came from discussion |
| `/supergraph:triage` | Issue state machine → ready-for-agent / needs-info / wontfix | Processing backlog |
| `/supergraph:prototype` | Throwaway code to validate approach | Uncertain approach before planning |

### Session & Productivity

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/supergraph:handoff` | Compact session state to file for next session | Context window exhausted, switching sessions |
| `/supergraph:caveman` | ~75% token compression mode | Long session, tight token budget |

### Domain-Specific

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/supergraph:serena` | LSP setup, tool reference, symbol navigation | Complex refactors, cross-file analysis |
| `/supergraph:database-migrations` | Schema changes, rollbacks, zero-downtime patterns | Any DB migration work |
| `/supergraph:flutter-ui` | Build Flutter UI from Figma MCP or image — scans design tokens, never hard-codes | Flutter UI from Figma or screenshot |
| `/supergraph:flutter-dart-code-review` | 15-section Flutter/Dart review checklist | Flutter/Dart code review |
| `/supergraph:frontend-design` | Production-grade UI — no generic AI aesthetics | Web UI components and layouts |
| `/supergraph:webapp-testing` | Playwright-based web application testing | E2E web testing |

---

## Smart Hooks

Skills are invoked manually. Hooks inject smart context automatically based on observable signals.

| Hook | Fires when | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Every session | Loads CONTEXT.md vocabulary; reminds about recent handoff; activates caveman if flagged; suggests zoom-out when no plan exists |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Every message | Detects caveman trigger phrases → activates compression; detects triage keywords → suggests triage |
| `PostToolUse Bash` | After Bash runs | Detects test failure patterns → injects `/supergraph:diagnose` suggestion |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | Fires urgent handoff reminder with active plan task counts |
| `PreToolUse Write/Edit` | Before writing source files | Checks plan exists and is approved |
| `PostToolUse Write/Edit` | After writing source files | Auto-updates code-review-graph index |
| `Stop` | When Claude stops | Reports plan progress + uncommitted changes |

**Activate caveman permanently** (persists across sessions):
```bash
echo "SUPERGRAPH_CAVEMAN=true" >> .supergraph-env
```

---

## Example Use Cases

**1. Adding a feature to a heavily-coupled service**

> "Add payment webhook handling to our API"

Scan detects `PaymentService` is a hub node connected to 14 modules. Plan shows blast radius before you write a line. TDD enforces a failing test first. Review catches the circular dependency before it ships.

---

**2. Debugging a flaky CI test**

> "Tests fail on CI but pass locally"

`/supergraph:diagnose` — 6-phase structured loop: reproduces the failure, maps involved files via graph traversal, checks for race conditions and env differences, proposes a targeted fix with evidence.

---

**3. Safe large-scale refactor**

> "Rename `UserService` to `AccountService` across the codebase"

Serena's `rename_symbol` + graph impact analysis shows every caller, test, and interface implementation before the rename runs. Zero broken imports.

---

**4. Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase**

> "I just joined this project. Where do I start?"

`/supergraph:zoom-out` generates a domain-vocabulary module map in seconds. `/supergraph:architecture` produces an HTML + Mermaid report you can share with the team.

---

**5. Processing a messy issue backlog**

> "We have 40 open issues. Which ones can we actually ship?"

`/supergraph:triage` classifies each issue through a formal state machine — **ready-for-agent**, **needs-info**, or **wontfix** — with reasoning. Turns backlog chaos into a sprint queue.

---

**6. Context window running out mid-task**

> "Been coding for 2 hours, context is getting long"

`/supergraph:handoff` compresses full session state — active plan tasks, uncommitted changes, decisions made, next steps — into a compact file. Resume in a fresh session in under 30 seconds.

---

**7. Zero-downtime database migration**

> "Add a NOT NULL column to a 2M-row users table"

`/supergraph:database-migrations` guides the expand-contract pattern: add nullable → backfill → add constraint → drop old column. Rollback scripts at every step, zero-downtime strategies per your ORM.

---

## Supported Languages

Auto-detected from config files at session start:

| Config file | Stack | Test | Lint | Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pubspec.yaml` | Flutter / Dart | flutter test | flutter analyze | dart format |
| `package.json` | Node.js / TypeScript | jest, vitest, mocha | eslint | prettier |
| `composer.json` | PHP | phpunit, pest | phpstan | php-cs-fixer |
| `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | Python | pytest | ruff | ruff format |
| `go.mod` | Go | go test | golangci-lint | gofmt |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | cargo test | cargo clippy | cargo fmt |

---

## Team Setup

Copy project scaffolding to your repo so the whole team shares the same workflow:

```bash
REPO=/path/to/your/repo

cp -r plugins/supergraph/.claude-plugin $REPO/.claude-plugin
cp -r plugins/supergraph/.github $REPO/.github
cp plugins/supergraph/.githooks/pre-commit $REPO/.githooks/
chmod +x $REPO/.githooks/pre-commit

cd $REPO
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
echo ".claude/settings.local.json" >> .gitignore
```

### What gets committed vs. what stays local

| Path | Commit? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude-plugin/` | ✅ Yes | Plugin manifest + skills shared across team |
| `.mcp.json` | ✅ Yes | MCP server config |
| `.code-review-graph/` | ✅ Yes | Graph index shared across team |
| `docs/supergraph/plans/` | ✅ Yes | Plans are contracts — visible to whole team |
| `CLAUDE.md` | ✅ Yes | Project-level instructions |
| `.supergraph-env` | ⚠️ Optional | Contains personal flags like CAVEMAN — add to `.gitignore` if personal |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | ❌ No | Personal tool permissions |

See [docs/TEAM-SETUP.md](./plugins/supergraph/docs/TEAM-SETUP.md) for CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, PR templates, and full onboarding guide.

---

## Hard Rules

These rules are enforced by the skill chain and hooks — not optional:

1. Never write code without a plan (skip only for trivial changes: <10 lines, 1 file)
2. Never implement without a failing test — TDD is mandatory
3. Never read entire codebase — use graph blast radius instead
4. Never modify hub nodes without explicit user approval
5. Never skip the auto-fix loop after coding
6. Never commit if tests fail or review returns CRITICAL
7. Always use graph MCP tools before assuming file relationships
8. Always detect language before running test/lint commands
9. Always read the skill file before executing each phase
10. Always save plans to `docs/supergraph/plans/` for multi-session work

---

## Escalation Table

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| TDD fails 3 times on the same task | Mark `stuck`, skip, continue next task |
| Fix loop fails 3 iterations | STOP — report issues — never commit broken |
| Review returns `NEEDS_CHANGES` | Return to fix (max 2 review cycles) |
| Review returns `BLOCKED` | Escalate to human immediately |
| Blast radius > 20 files | STOP — discuss with user before proceeding |
| Hub node modification | Require explicit user approval |
| Surprise score > 0.7 | Require investigation and justification |
| New circular dependency detected | Block — fix before merge |

## Privacy

Supergraph is **local-first** — no remote servers, no telemetry, no code uploaded anywhere.

All graph analysis runs on your machine. Plan files stay in your repo. The only external services involved are Claude Code (Anthropic) for model inference and optionally Serena / code-review-graph, both of which run locally.

See [PRIVACY.md](./plugins/supergraph/PRIVACY.md) for the full policy.

---

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./plugins/supergraph/CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.

**Current: v2.2.1** — Added `flutter-ui` skill: build Flutter UI from Figma MCP or image with token-safe code generation, `flutter_gen` asset management, and variant/state mapping.

**v2.2.0** — Added 8 new skills (diagnose, handoff, triage, caveman, prd, architecture, prototype, zoom-out), CONTEXT.md shared vocabulary system, 4 smart automation hooks.
